#zChat
An experiment with chat and sockets in Node..

**commands:**
+ **/nick [new-nick]** = change your nickname.
+ **/join [room-name]** = join a room.
+ **/leave** = leave current room.

Can also click on tabs to switch room focus and leave rooms.

**TODO:**
+ auto-scrolling etc.
+ server file caching.
+ direct messaging.
+ channel ops: kick, ban, etc.

Think of more stuff..
